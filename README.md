This are just odds and ends, mostly little scripts that I have found useful,
and which I install on pretty much every Linux system I use. You can assume
that they are all licensed under the GNU Public License version 2.

NOTES

I'm working on some scripts to backup and restore the various Raspberry Pi
single board computers I have scattered around that run 24x7 with various
applications. I have yet to have this backup/restore procedure work
consistently without issues. It is a work in progress.
